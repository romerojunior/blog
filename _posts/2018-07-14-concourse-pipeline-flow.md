This is just a small contribution for those starting with [Concourse CI](https://concourse-ci.org/). As Concourse claims to be built on the simple mechanics of resources, tasks, and job, I will assume you are already familiar with these concepts.

The diagram below is just a visual representation of how data may flow from task to task and from job to job within a pipeline (only taking into account: `get`, `put` and `task` [steps](https://concourse-ci.org/steps.html)).

Each arrow contains a description (`get`, `put`, `inputs`, `outputs`) that maps directly to the key you will use in your pipeline YAML definition. The diagram above could be written as the following pseudo-pipeline:

```yml
---
resources:
  - name: resource-x
    type: git
    source: # (...)

  - name: resource-y
    type: git
    source: # (...)

  - name: resource-z
    type: artifactory
    source: # (...)

jobs:

  - name: job-a
    plan:
      - get: resource-x

      - task: task-a
        config:
          platform: # (...)
          image_resource: # (...)

          inputs:
            - name: resource-x

          run: # (...)

          outputs:
            - name: my-result-a

      - task: task-b
        config:
          platform: # (...)
          image_resource: # (...)

          inputs:
            - name: my-result-a

          run: # (...)

          outputs:
            - name: my-result-b

      - task: task-c
        config:
          platform: # (...)
          image_resource: # (...)

          inputs:
            - name: my-result-b

          run: # (...)

          outputs:
            - name: resource-z

      - put: resource-z

  - name: job-b
    plan:
      - get: resource-y

      - task: task-a
        config:
          platform: # (...)
          image_resource: # (...)

          inputs:
            - name: resource-y

          run: # (...)

          outputs:
            - name: my-result-a

      - task: task-b
        config:
          platform: # (...)
          image_resource: # (...)

          inputs:
            - name: my-result-a

          run: # (...)

          outputs:
            - name: my-result-b

      - task: task-c
        config:
          platform: # (...)
          image_resource: # (...)

          inputs:
            - name: my-result-b

          run: # (...)

          outputs:
            - name: # (...)

# and so on...
```

Even though the official documentation only covers `volumes` from a reasonably broad perspective, I think it's essential to understand their role within a pipeline context a bit deeper.
