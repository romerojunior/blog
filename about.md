# Cortex

Writing has always helped me understanding the nature of things, consequently I have been using colored pens and paper from a young age to either explain myself things I recently learned, illustrate through drawings (nowadays diagrams) the relationship or flow between different topics, or perhaps to visually define the boundaries of a new definition.

By itself, this "habitual pattern of behavior" doesn't make one a good writer, but it has certainly contributed positively. Writing is a daily practise that I have been exercising both professionally and as a productive coping mechanism.

This collection of information, called Cortex, is nothing but an extension of my long-lasting childhood understanding process. In this space, I will attempt to consolidade thoughts with regard to various topics, but given my current interests the reader is most likely to come across technical texts rather than, let's say, a risotto recipe, even though the latter should not be discarded.

Any contribution, correction or debate can be started directly through [this](https://github.com/romerojunior/cortex) Github repository.
